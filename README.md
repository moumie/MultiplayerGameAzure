# MultiplayerGameAzure
Recent years have been marked by the raise of new technological trends ranging from the cloud computing,   
unprecedented   adoption   of   Javascript   platforms,   NoSql   database   systems   for   the development  
of  traditional  applications  as  well  as  the  gaming  on  mobile  devices.  In  the  mist  of  this revolution,
we have set to analyze challenges posed by this new system in the development of realtime applications. 
Our  main  objectives  are  the  development  of  a  realtime  multiplayer  game using  nodeJs, socket.io,  
azure   and   Mongodb;   design a   web   application   targeting   primarily  mobile   phones;   
the analysis   and evaluation of application scalability, security and privacy; and finally to report and analyze challenges.
